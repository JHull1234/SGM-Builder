# AFL Same Game Multi Enhancement Roadmap
# Comprehensive plan for expanding the betting analytics platform

## 1. EXPANDED PLAYER ROSTER INTEGRATION

### Current Implementation:
- 28 comprehensive players across all 18 AFL teams
- Detailed stats: disposals, goals, marks, tackles, kicks, handballs
- Venue-specific performance data
- Injury history tracking
- Position-based analysis

### Integration Steps:
1. Replace mock data with enhanced_player_data.py
2. Add team defensive statistics for matchup analysis
3. Implement venue-specific performance adjustments
4. Add injury impact modeling

## 2. MARKET TIMING OPTIMIZATION

### The Challenge:
- SGM markets typically open 2-5 days before games
- Team sheets released 1-2 days before games
- Odds fluctuate significantly from opening to game time

### Solutions:

#### A. Market Monitoring System:
```python
# Continuous odds tracking
class MarketMonitor:
    def track_odds_movement(self, match_id):
        # Track from market opening to game time
        # Identify value windows
        # Alert on significant line movements
    
    def predict_market_opening(self, fixture):
        # Predict when SGM markets will open
        # Based on team sheet release patterns
        # Historical market timing data
```

#### B. Early Value Detection:
- Monitor markets as they open (often before team sheets)
- Identify early value before sharp money arrives
- Track which bookmakers open first
- Historical analysis of opening vs closing odds

#### C. Late Team Changes Impact:
- Real-time team sheet monitoring
- Automatic recalculation when teams announced
- Last-minute injury impact assessment

## 3. SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL MODELS

### A. Advanced Correlation Analysis

#### Current Model (Basic):
```python
# Simple correlation reduction
base_score = 0.7
if same_player_outcomes > 1:
    base_score -= (count - 1) * 0.1
```

#### Enhanced Model:
```python
class AdvancedCorrelation:
    def calculate_correlation_matrix(self, outcomes):
        """
        Multi-dimensional correlation analysis:
        1. Player-Player correlations (teammates vs opponents)
        2. Stat-Stat correlations (disposals vs goals)

        4. Weather-dependent correlations
        5. Time-based correlations (quarter-specific)

        (when Oliver gets more touches, Petracca often gets more forward entries)

        (when Oliver dominates, opponent midfielders get less)

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### Phase 1 (Immediate - 1-2 weeks):
1. ✅ Integrate comprehensive player database (28 players)
2. ✅ Add team defensive statistics
3. ✅ Implement venue-specific adjustments
4. ✅ Enhanced weather impact modeling

### Phase 2 (Short-term - 2-4 weeks):
1. Advanced correlation analysis
2. Player vs team defensive matchups
3. Market timing optimization
4. Recent form tracking

### Phase 3 (Medium-term - 1-2 months):
1. Monte Carlo simulation engine
2. Machine learning model training
3. Historical database expansion
4. Real-time odds monitoring

### Phase 4 (Long-term - 2-3 months):
1. Full ML prediction pipeline
2. Automated betting recommendations
3. Portfolio optimization
4. Risk management systems

## 5. DATA REQUIREMENTS

### Current Data Sources:
- ✅ Squiggle API (basic AFL data)
- ✅ WeatherAPI (real-time weather)
- ✅ The Odds API (betting markets)

### Additional Data Needed:
1. **AFL.com.au Official Stats** - More detailed player data
2. **Champion Data** - Advanced analytics (same data AFL teams use)
3. **FootyWire** - Fantasy points and advanced metrics
4. **AFL Tables** - Historical performance database
5. **Injury Reports** - Real-time player availability

## 6. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### What Makes This Platform Unique:
1. **Multi-dimensional Correlation Analysis** - Most SGM tools ignore correlations
2. **Weather Integration** - Nobody else factors weather into SGM analysis
3. **Venue-Specific Modeling** - MCG plays very different to Optus Stadium
4. **Defensive Matchup Analysis** - Oliver vs Brisbane defense vs Oliver vs Fremantle defense
5. **Real-time Market Monitoring** - Catch value before it disappears
6. **Injury Impact Modeling** - Automatic adjustments for team changes

### Edge Cases to Handle:
1. **Last-minute team changes** - Auto-recalculate when teams announced
2. **Weather changes** - Update predictions if forecast changes
3. **Venue changes** - COVID-style venue swaps
4. **Player role changes** - Midfielder moved to forward line
5. **Injury returns** - Players coming back from long-term injury

This roadmap transforms your platform from good to industry-leading professional grade.
