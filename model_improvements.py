        "issue": "Mock data showed Oliver as 'hot' when he's actually been quiet",
        "fix": "Need real recent game data, not mock historical trends",
        "impact": "High - wrong form assessment leads to wrong predictions"

        "issue": "Overweighted positive correlation between Oliver/Petracca",
        "fix": "Reduce teammate bonuses from +0.05 to +0.01",
        "impact": "Medium - synergy less important than individual variance"
    },
    
    "target_line_setting": {
        "issue": "Lines too optimistic (Daicos 25.5 vs actual 19)",
        "fix": "Add more conservative buffer and higher variance modeling",
        "impact": "High - need more realistic target expectations"

    "individual_variance": {
        "issue": "Didn't account for high game-to-game variance (Petracca 0 goals)",
        "fix": "Increase standard deviations in probability calculations",
        "impact": "Critical - individual games have massive variance"
    },

        "issue": "May have underestimated cold weather impact on skill execution",
        "fix": "Increase penalties for temperatures below 12Â°C",
        "impact": "Low-Medium - weather factors may be more significant"
