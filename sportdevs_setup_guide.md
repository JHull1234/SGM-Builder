# SportDevs API Integration Guide - Ready for €19/month Major Plan

## Once you get your SportDevs API key, here's what we'll do:

### 1. Add API Key to Environment
```bash
# Update /app/backend/.env
SPORTDEVS_API_KEY="your_new_sportdevs_api_key_here"
```

### 2. Test API Access
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.sportdevs.com/v1/aussie-rules/teams" | jq .

# Test player search
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  "https://api.sportdevs.com/v1/aussie-rules/players?name=Clayton%20Oliver" | jq .
```
